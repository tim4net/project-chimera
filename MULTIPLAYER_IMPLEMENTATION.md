## üìù Next Steps for Developers

**To Continue Multiplayer:**
1. Read ADR-003 and ADR-004 in `project.md`
2. Build frontend party UI components
3. Implement real-time party state synchronization
4. Test with 2+ players

**To Continue Factions:**
1. Read ADR-007 in `project.md`
2. Populate `factions` table with initial factions
3. Implement reputation gain/loss in rule engine
4. Generate Major NPC personas with Gemini

**To Continue Epochs:**
1. Read ADR-012 in `project.md`
2. Define story arc completion criteria
3. Build world modification service
4. Test epoch triggers

## üîß Technical Notes

**Party Synchronization:**
- Use Supabase real-time subscriptions for party state
- WebSockets for turn coordination
- Optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution

**Faction Reputation:**
- Already exists: `characters.reputation_scores` (JSONB)
- Already exists: `characters.reputation_tags` (array)
- Integrate with existing systems

**Epoch Storage:**
- Each epoch increments `epoch_number`
- World changes stored as JSONB diffs
- Apply changes atomically to maintain consistency

## ‚úÖ Current State

**Status:** Foundation complete, ready for implementation
**Time Investment:** 3 hours (database + API foundation)
**Remaining:** 8-12 weeks for full features
**Next Owner:** Future developer or continued iteration

**The architecture is sound and ready to build upon!**
