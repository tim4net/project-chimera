# Orchestrator Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Infinite Loop (Critical)
**Problem:** Orchestrator created 100+ duplicate commits in an infinite loop
- State file was being appended to with text instead of proper JSON
- No completion condition - script ran forever
- State checking logic didn't work with corrupted state format

**Solution:**
- Replaced text append (`echo >> file`) with proper JSON updates using `jq`
- Added explicit exit condition when all tasks complete
- Implemented `get_state_value()` helper for reliable state queries
- State file now maintains valid JSON structure at all times

### 2. Git Push Failures
**Problem:** GitHub blocked pushes due to secrets in `.env` file history
- Orchestrator crashed on push failures
- Secrets were committed in early repository history
- No error handling for push failures

**Solution:**
- Added graceful error handling for git push operations
- Detects GitHub secret scanning blocks (GH013 errors)
- Continues working even if push fails (commits saved locally)
- Added upstream branch handling with fallback

### 3. State Tracking
**Problem:** State file format was inconsistent and caused logic errors
- Mixed JSON and text entries
- Duplicate state markers
- grep checks failed on malformed JSON

**Solution:**
- Standardized on JSON format: `{  "supabase_setup_complete": bool, "backend_server_initialized": bool }`
- Use `jq` for all state file operations
- Initialize state file properly if missing or corrupted
- Added `reset_state_if_needed()` for self-healing

### 4. Commit Messages
**Problem:** Commit messages contained entire multi-line plans
- Made git history hard to read
- Caused formatting issues

**Solution:**
- Extract only first line of plan for commit message
- Truncate to 72 characters max
- Prefix with "AI: " for clarity

## Files Modified

- `build_orchestrator.sh` - Complete rewrite with all fixes
- `project_state.json` - Converted to proper JSON format
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added troubleshooting documentation
- Git history cleaned (reset to before infinite loop)

## Testing

All fixes verified:
- ✓ Syntax check passes
- ✓ State tracking uses valid JSON
- ✓ Exit condition properly implemented
- ✓ Push failures handled gracefully
- ✓ No infinite loops

## Before vs After

**Before:**
- 112 commits in infinite loop
- Malformed state file
- Crashes on git push errors
- Never completes

**After:**
- Completes successfully with exit code 0
- Valid JSON state tracking
- Graceful error handling
- Self-healing capabilities
