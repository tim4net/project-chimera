        Project: Project Chimera
        Primary Goal: Build the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Project Chimera. The MVP includes: a functioning backend server; a database that can store and manage a single player's character data; a web UI that displays the procedurally generated map with Fog of War and a basic, real-time journal feed; the ability to set two Idle Phase tasks (Travel and Scout); a functional Active Phase system with a modal overlay and Choice Matrix; and the implementation of only Layer 1, Template-Based Radiant Quests.
        Current State: {"last_executed_plan": "echo 'Initializing backend server...'
echo 'backend_server_initialized' >> project_state.json"}
