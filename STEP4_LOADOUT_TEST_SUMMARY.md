# Step 4 Loadout - Test Implementation Summary

## Task Completion: ✅ COMPLETE

**Developer**: Frontend Developer 2
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Task**: Write 22 tests for Step 4 Loadout (TDD RED Phase)
**Branch**: `feature/step4-loadout-1-tests`

---

## Deliverables

### Test File
- **Location**: `/srv/project-chimera/frontend/src/components/character-creation-v2/steps/Step4Loadout/Step4Loadout.test.tsx`
- **Total Tests**: 22
- **Status**: All tests FAILING (RED phase - expected and correct)
- **TypeScript**: ✅ No compilation errors
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library

### Stub Implementation
- **Location**: `/srv/project-chimera/frontend/src/components/character-creation-v2/steps/Step4Loadout/Step4Loadout.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Minimal stub to allow tests to import and run
- **Status**: Intentionally incomplete (implementation is next phase)

## Test Coverage Breakdown

### 1. Equipment Preset Tests (5 tests)
✅ Written
- Renders 3-4 presets based on character class
- Shows preset name, description, and icon
- Selects preset with gold highlight
- Can change preset selection
- Updates preview when preset selected

### 2. Equipment Preview Tests (3 tests)
✅ Written
- Shows visual representation of gear
- Updates when preset changes
- Shows equipment name and type (Weapon, Armor, Shield)

### 3. Appearance Input Tests (5 tests)
✅ Written
- Renders textarea with placeholder
- Max 150 characters enforced
- Shows character counter (X/150)
- Allows multiline input
- Next button disabled if appearance < 5 chars

### 4. Portrait Generation Tests (6 tests)
✅ Written
- Renders portrait canvas/placeholder
- "Generate Portrait" button visible
- Clicking calls portraitService
- Shows loading spinner during generation
- Displays generated portrait
- "Upload Custom" button available

### 5. Portrait Upload Tests (2 tests)
✅ Written
- File input for custom upload
- Validates image files (JPG/PNG)

### 6. Navigation Tests (1 test)
✅ Written
- Previous button goes to Step 3
- Next button enabled when valid

---

## Test Quality Standards Met

✅ **TypeScript Strict Mode**: No `any` types, full type safety
✅ **Clear Test Names**: Descriptive, behavior-focused names
✅ **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert structure
✅ **Comprehensive Mocking**: portraitService mocked with configurable responses
✅ **Async Handling**: Proper use of `waitFor()` for async operations
✅ **testId Usage**: Consistent data-testid attributes
✅ **Comments**: Complex async tests documented

---

## Test Execution Results

```
Test Files: 1 failed (1)
Tests: 22 failed (22)
Duration: ~200ms

All 22 tests are FAILING as expected (RED phase).
This is correct for Test-Driven Development.
```

### Expected Failures
All tests fail because the implementation is a stub. This is **intentional and correct** for TDD:
1. Write failing tests first (RED) ✅ **← We are here**
2. Implement code to pass tests (GREEN) ← Next phase
3. Refactor while keeping tests green (REFACTOR) ← Final phase

---

## Data Structures Defined

### CharacterDraft Extension (Step 4)
```typescript
interface CharacterDraft {
  // ... existing fields from Steps 1-3

  // Step 4: Loadout
  equipment?: string[];
  startingGold?: number;
  selectedEquipment?: string[];
  portraitUrl?: string;
  appearance?: string;
}
```

### Equipment Presets (to be implemented)
Presets vary by class:
- **Fighter**: Sword & Shield, Two-Handed, Ranged, Dual Wield
- **Wizard**: Staff, Wand & Dagger, Arcane Focus
- **Rogue**: Dual Daggers, Short Sword, Ranged
- **Cleric**: Mace & Shield, Warhammer, Holy Symbol

---

## Integration Points

### Context Integration
- Uses `CharacterDraftContextV2` for state management
- Draft update via `updateDraft()` callback
- Validation via `validateStep4()` from context

### Service Integration
- **portraitService**: AI portrait generation via backend API
- Mock implementation for testing: `generatePortraitMock()`
- Real implementation: POST to `/api/character-portrait/generate`

### Navigation Flow
- Previous: Step 3 (Abilities & Skills)
- Current: Step 4 (Loadout)
- Next: Step 5 (Review & Confirm)

## Next Steps for Implementation Team

### Phase 1: Equipment Presets (Est: 4 hours)
1. Create `EquipmentPresets.tsx` component
2. Define preset data structures by class
3. Implement preset selection logic
4. Style with gold highlight for selected state

### Phase 2: Equipment Preview (Est: 2 hours)
1. Create `EquipmentPreview.tsx` component
2. Display equipment icons and names
3. Show equipment types (Weapon, Armor, etc.)

### Phase 3: Appearance Input (Est: 2 hours)
1. Create `AppearanceInput.tsx` component
2. Implement 150-char textarea with counter
3. Add validation for min 5 chars

### Phase 4: Portrait Generation (Est: 6 hours)
1. Create `PortraitGenerator.tsx` component
2. Implement AI portrait generation with loading states
3. Handle success/error states
4. Add custom upload functionality

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish (Est: 2 hours)
1. Integrate all components into `Step4Loadout.tsx`
2. Add navigation buttons (Previous/Next)
3. Implement validation logic
4. Test all 22 tests pass (GREEN phase)

**Total Estimated Time**: 16 hours (2 developer days)

- [x] Tests are clear and specific
- [x] No implementation code (tests only)
- [x] TypeScript strict mode passes
- [x] Ready for implementation phase
- [x] Follows existing test patterns (Step 3)
- [x] Uses test utilities from testUtils.ts
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage across all UI sections

## Notes for Future Developers

1. **Equipment Data**: Equipment presets should be defined in a separate data file (e.g., `data/equipmentPresets.ts`) to keep components clean
2. **Portrait Service**: Already implemented at `/srv/project-chimera/frontend/src/services/portraitService.ts` - use this for integration
3. **Class-Based Logic**: Equipment presets should vary based on `draft.class` - reference class data structures
4. **Validation**: Step 4 validation requires at least 1 equipment item and appearance text (5+ chars)
5. **Design System**: Use existing design tokens from the v2 design system for consistency
