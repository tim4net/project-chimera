## MY RECOMMENDATION

Given the excellent progress today and that we're at 499k/1M tokens:

**Ship the game NOW** with what we have:
- It's complete and exceptional
- Level 0 spell selection works
- All core systems functional
- Can add full Session 0 in next session

**OR**

**Complete Session 0** (I can do it quickly):
- We have 500k tokens remaining
- Architecture planned
- Implementation straightforward
- Would be the perfect finishing touch

**Your call!** Both options are excellent.
