## 🎉 Summary

The Nuaibria TUI has made **significant progress** with core systems complete:

**✅ What's Working:**
- User authentication (--user flag)
- AI DM chat integration
- Real-time gameplay for existing characters
- Full dashboard UI

**📋 What's Needed:**
- Character creation (7-10 days)
- Combat system (5-7 days)
- Quest & progression (5-7 days)
- Additional features (6-10 days)

**Total Remaining Effort:** 23-34 days for full parity

**Current Status:** **PLAYABLE but INCOMPLETE**

The TUI provides a functional command-line interface for players with existing characters, but requires the web interface for character creation and lacks combat/quest UIs. Implementing the remaining critical features (Phases 1-2) would make the TUI fully self-sufficient.
