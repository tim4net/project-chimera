# Travel WebSocket Integration - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All TypeScript compilation successful

## Overview

Successfully integrated travel system events into the Socket.io WebSocket infrastructure, enabling real-time updates for frontend clients during travel sessions.

## Changes Made

### 1. WebSocket Event Types (`backend/src/types/websocket.ts`)

Added four new travel-specific server events to `ServerEvents` enum:
- `TRAVEL_SESSION_START` - Emitted when a new travel session begins
- `TRAVEL_EVENT` - Emitted when a travel event requires player response
- `TRAVEL_EVENT_RESOLVED` - Emitted after player makes a choice
- `TRAVEL_PROGRESS` - Emitted every minute during active travel

Added corresponding TypeScript interfaces:
- `TravelSessionStartEvent` - Session metadata, destination, total miles, danger level
- `TravelEventEvent` - Event details including choices available to player
- `TravelEventResolvedEvent` - Choice outcome and consequence
- `TravelProgressEvent` - Current progress, miles traveled, percentage complete, ETA

### 2. Travel Routes (`backend/src/routes/travel.ts`)

**Imports Added:**
```typescript
import { broadcastToCharacter } from '../websocket';
import { ServerEvents } from '../types/websocket';
import type {
  TravelSessionStartEvent,
  TravelEventEvent,
  TravelEventResolvedEvent,
} from '../types/websocket';
```

**POST `/api/travel/start` - Session Start Emission:**
- After creating travel session in database
- Emits `TRAVEL_SESSION_START` event to character's WebSocket room
- Includes session ID, destination, total miles, and danger level

**GET `/api/travel/status/:sessionId` - Active Event Emission:**
- When unresolved event exists requiring player response
- Emits `TRAVEL_EVENT` event with event details and choices
- Called by frontend to check for new events

**POST `/api/travel/choose` - Resolution Emission:**
- After resolving player's choice
- Emits `TRAVEL_EVENT_RESOLVED` event with choice and consequence
- Includes skill check results if applicable

### 3. Travel Worker (`backend/src/workers/travelWorker.ts`) - NEW FILE

**Purpose:** Background worker running every 60 seconds to handle:
- Incrementing `miles_traveled` for active sessions
- Checking arrival at destination
- Rolling for random encounters
- Generating and emitting travel events
- Broadcasting `TRAVEL_PROGRESS` updates

**Configuration:**
```typescript
TICK_INTERVAL_MS = 60000 (1 minute)
MILES_PER_TICK = {
  cautious: 0.033 miles/minute (2 mph)
  normal: 0.05 miles/minute (3 mph)
  hasty: 0.067 miles/minute (4 mph)
}
ENCOUNTER_CHANCE = {
  cautious: 1% per minute
  normal: 1.5% per minute
  hasty: 2.5% per minute
}
```

**Worker Functions:**
- `processTravelSessionTick(session)` - Update progress, emit TRAVEL_PROGRESS, check completion
- `rollForEncounter(session)` - Random encounter generation with WebSocket emission
- `tick()` - Main loop processing all active sessions
- `startTravelWorker()` / `stopTravelWorker()` - Lifecycle management

**Event Generation:**
- Uses `generateTravelEvent()` from `travelService.ts`
- Auto-resolves trivial events that don't require player input
- Emits `TRAVEL_EVENT` via WebSocket for player-response events
- Updates character position to destination coordinates upon arrival

### 4. Server Integration (`backend/src/server.ts`)

**Imports Added:**
```typescript
import {
  startTravelWorker,
  stopTravelWorker,
} from './workers/travelWorker';
```

**Startup:**
- Added `startTravelWorker()` call after server starts listening
- Worker begins processing active travel sessions immediately

**Shutdown:**
- Added `stopTravelWorker()` to both SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers
- Ensures clean worker shutdown before server closes

## WebSocket Room Architecture

Travel events are broadcast using character-based rooms:
- Room format: `character:{characterId}`
- Clients join their character's room upon authentication
- Events are broadcast only to the specific character's room using `broadcastToCharacter()`

## Event Flow

### Starting Travel
1. Frontend → POST `/api/travel/start` with `character_id` and `destination_id`
2. Backend creates session in `travel_sessions` table
3. Backend emits `TRAVEL_SESSION_START` event via WebSocket
4. Frontend receives real-time notification of session creation

### Travel Progress (Every Minute)
1. Travel worker tick fires (every 60 seconds)
2. Worker increments `miles_traveled` for active sessions
3. Worker emits `TRAVEL_PROGRESS` event with current percentage
4. Worker rolls for encounter (based on travel mode)
5. If encounter triggered:
   - Generate event using `travelService.generateTravelEvent()`
   - Insert event into `travel_events` table
   - If `requires_response = true`: Emit `TRAVEL_EVENT` via WebSocket
   - If `requires_response = false`: Auto-resolve and continue

### Player Response to Event
1. Frontend → POST `/api/travel/choose` with `sessionId` and `choiceLabel`
2. Backend performs skill check if required
3. Backend marks event as resolved in database
4. Backend emits `TRAVEL_EVENT_RESOLVED` event via WebSocket
5. Frontend receives outcome and updates UI

### Arrival at Destination
1. Travel worker detects `miles_traveled >= miles_total`
2. Worker sets session status to `completed`
3. Worker updates character position to destination coordinates
4. Worker emits final `TRAVEL_PROGRESS` event with 100% completion
5. No further encounter rolls for this session

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation successful (no errors)
- [x] Build output verified (`dist/routes/travel.js`, `dist/workers/travelWorker.js`)
- [ ] Frontend WebSocket listener configured to receive events
- [ ] Test: Start travel session, verify `TRAVEL_SESSION_START` in browser console
- [ ] Test: Wait 1 minute, verify `TRAVEL_PROGRESS` event received
- [ ] Test: Trigger encounter, verify `TRAVEL_EVENT` with choices
- [ ] Test: Make choice, verify `TRAVEL_EVENT_RESOLVED` with consequence
- [ ] Test: Complete journey, verify final `TRAVEL_PROGRESS` with 100%

## Frontend Integration Requirements

To receive WebSocket events, the frontend must:

1. **Connect to WebSocket server:**
```typescript
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';
const socket = io('http://localhost:3001');
```

2. **Listen for travel events:**
```typescript
socket.on('travel:session_start', (data: TravelSessionStartEvent) => {
  console.log('Travel started:', data);
});

socket.on('travel:progress', (data: TravelProgressEvent) => {
  console.log('Travel progress:', data.percentage + '%');
});

socket.on('travel:event', (data: TravelEventEvent) => {
  console.log('Event requires response:', data);
  // Display choices to player
});

socket.on('travel:event_resolved', (data: TravelEventResolvedEvent) => {
  console.log('Choice result:', data.consequence);
});
```

3. **Join character room (after authentication):**
```typescript
socket.emit('subscribe:character', { characterId: 'your-char-id' });
```

## Files Modified

1. `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/types/websocket.ts` - Added travel event types
2. `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/routes/travel.ts` - Added WebSocket emissions
3. `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/server.ts` - Integrated travel worker lifecycle
4. `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/workers/travelWorker.ts` - NEW FILE (travel worker)

## Files Created

- `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/workers/travelWorker.ts` (258 lines)

## Build Status

✅ **TypeScript Compilation:** PASSED (no errors)  
✅ **Output Files Generated:** Confirmed  
✅ **Integration Complete:** All event emissions wired

## Known Limitations

1. **Region Context:** Currently uses placeholder biome ('wilderness'). TODO: Integrate with world map service
2. **Danger Level:** Calculated from travel mode only. TODO: Use actual region danger_level from map
3. **Destination Name:** Uses destination_id string. Enhancement: Lookup POI name for better UX
4. **Frontend Listener:** Not yet implemented. Frontend must add WebSocket event handlers

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend WebSocket Setup:**
   - Add Socket.io client dependency
   - Create WebSocket service/hook
   - Implement event listeners
   - Update UI to show real-time travel progress

2. **Testing:**
   - Start backend server and verify worker logs
   - Connect frontend WebSocket client
   - Test full travel flow from start to completion
   - Verify events received in browser console

3. **Enhancements:**
   - Integrate actual world map biome/danger lookups
   - Add POI name resolution for better event descriptions
   - Implement travel mode modifiers (cautious = safer, hasty = faster + riskier)

**Integration Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Ready for Frontend Implementation:** YES  
**Backend Tests Required:** Integration tests for WebSocket emissions
