**CANTRIP SELECTION**

${intro}

**What are cantrips?**
Cantrips are Level 0 spells. Unlike higher-level spells that consume spell slots, you can cast cantrips unlimited times. They're less powerful than leveled spells, but their unlimited use makes them essential for any spellcaster.

**Your available cantrips:**

${cantripList}

**You must choose exactly ${count} cantrip${count > 1 ? 's' : ''}.**

ðŸ’¡ **Tips for beginners:**
- Include at least one combat cantrip (for when spell slots run out)
- Utility cantrips can solve problems creatively
- Don't worry too much - you'll gain more cantrips as you level up

**Please tell me which ${count} cantrip${count > 1 ? 's' : ''} you'd like to learn.** Type their names clearly (e.g., "I choose Fire Bolt and Prestidigitation").

If you choose fewer or more than ${count}, I'll politely remind you how many you need to select.

**SPELL PREPARATION (Not Selection)**

Congratulations on choosing your cantrips: ${selectedCantrips.join(', ')}!

**Good news:** As a ${characterClass}, you don't choose a fixed list of spells. Instead, you **prepare** spells each day from your full class spell list.

**How it works:**
- You have access to ALL ${characterClass} spells of levels you can cast
- Each morning, you prepare ${prepareCount} spells
- You can change your prepared spells after a long rest
- This gives you amazing flexibility!

**For now:** Your tutorial character starts with a default prepared spell list. Once you reach Level 1, you'll be able to choose which spells to prepare each day.

ðŸŽ‰ **Tutorial complete!** You're ready to begin your adventure. Type "ready" or describe what you'd like to do first.

**LEVEL 1 SPELL SELECTION**

Great choices on cantrips: ${selectedCantrips.join(', ')}!

${intro}

**What are spell slots?**
Spell slots are your magical energy reserves. Each time you cast a leveled spell, you consume one slot of the appropriate level. You regain all spell slots after a long rest. At Level 1, you'll have 2 first-level spell slots.

**Your available Level 1 spells:**

${spellList}

**You must choose exactly ${count} spell${count > 1 ? 's' : ''}.**

ðŸ’¡ **Tips for beginners:**
- Balance offense and defense/utility
- Consider spells that complement your cantrips
- Think about your character's personality - what magic fits their style?
- Healing spells can save your life (or your party's)

**Please tell me which ${count} spell${count > 1 ? 's' : ''} you'd like to learn.** Type their names clearly.

If you choose fewer or more than ${count}, I'll gently correct you.
