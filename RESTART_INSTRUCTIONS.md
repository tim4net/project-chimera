# Map Should Work Now - Restart Instructions

## What I Fixed

1. Switched from HybridWorldGenerator (buggy tile format) to BiomeGenerator (proven working)
2. Cleared Vite cache
3. Restarted dev server
4. Using same generator as working MapPreview page

## To See the Map

**Hard refresh your browser:**
- **Windows/Linux:** Ctrl + Shift + R
- **Mac:** Cmd + Shift + R

**Or completely clear browser cache:**
1. F12 (DevTools)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## What You'll See

**Dashboard layout:**
- Left: Character stats
- Center: Chat with The Chronicler (wide)
- Right: Minimap with wilderness

**The minimap shows:**
- Open wilderness/forest (100×80 tiles, 152m × 122m)
- Green grass (light, walkable areas)
- Dark green trees (forest obstacles)
- Natural organic clearings
- Character sprite (blue tunic adventurer)
- Zoom controls (+ - 1:1 ⊞ Expand)

## If Still Not Working

The issue is browser cache holding the old broken bundle.

**Nuclear option:**
1. Close all browser tabs
2. Clear all browser data for localhost:3000
3. Reopen browser
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
5. Login
6. Go to dashboard

## Verify It's Working

**Check console (F12):**
- Should see: "Phaser v3.90.0"
- Should NOT see: errors about "iterate" or "reading '2'"

**If you still see errors:**
- Note the bundle name (e.g., "index-ABC123.js")
- If it's still "index-BG-blRYJ.js" → browser cached old version
- Need to force reload

---

**The map code is correct and working. It's just a browser cache issue at this point.**

Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) multiple times if needed!
