## 📋 Your Next Steps (Choose One)

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
**Time: 15 minutes**

Read this file first (you are here!)
→ Open: `/srv/project-chimera/DEPLOY_NOW.txt`
→ Follow the 3-step deployment

### Option 2: Thorough Understanding
**Time: 30 minutes**

1. Read: `/srv/project-chimera/TRAVEL_SYSTEM_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (overview)
2. Read: `/srv/project-chimera/TRAVEL_DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` (detailed guide)
3. Deploy following the 4-step process

### Option 3: Deep Dive (For Architecture Review)
**Time: 60+ minutes**

1. Review architecture: `/srv/project-chimera/TRAVEL_SYSTEM_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
2. Read deployment guide: `/srv/project-chimera/TRAVEL_DEPLOYMENT_READY.md`
3. Review test plan: `/srv/project-chimera/TRAVEL_E2E_TEST_GUIDE.md`
4. Check integration checklist: `/srv/project-chimera/TRAVEL_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`

## 🚀 TL;DR - Three Commands

If you just want to get it running:

```bash
# 1. Apply migrations (copy/paste SQL in Supabase web UI)
cat /srv/project-chimera/TRAVEL_MIGRATIONS_COMBINED.sql

# 2. Restart backend
podman compose restart backend

# 3. Verify it works
podman compose logs backend 2>&1 | grep -i travel | head -5
```

Then head to `/srv/project-chimera/DEPLOY_NOW.txt` for detailed steps.

## ✨ What Was Built

### Backend Services
- **Travel Service** (`travelService.ts`) - Encounter generation, severity calculation
- **API Routes** (`travel.ts`) - 3 REST endpoints for travel control
- **Travel Worker** (`travelWorker.ts`) - 60-second background processor
- **WebSocket** (`websocket/index.ts`) - Real-time event broadcasting

### Frontend
- **Travel Status Hook** (`useTravelStatus.ts`) - State management + WebSocket
- **Travel Panel** (`TravelPanel.tsx`) - UI component showing progress

### Database
- `travel_sessions` table - Tracks active/historical journeys
- `travel_events` table - Records encounters during travel
- `world_pois.danger_level` column - Region difficulty (1-5)

## 🎮 Core Features

✅ **Danger-Level Scaling**
- Safe zones: 7.5% encounter chance, mostly trivial events
- Deadly zones: 37.5% encounter chance, mostly lethal events
- 5 severity levels automatically balanced

✅ **Real-Time Updates**
- WebSocket broadcasts every 60 seconds
- Players see live travel progress
- Instant event notifications

✅ **Smart Encounters**
- Trivial events auto-resolve (no player needed)
- Moderate+ events present meaningful choices
- D&D 5e skill check integration for outcomes

✅ **Non-Blocking UI**
- Travel in separate panel
- Doesn't interrupt main chat interface
- Idle-game appropriate
