## What Was Verified (Part A: Implementation Readiness)

### 1. Backend Services Status
- ✅ Backend container: RUNNING
- ✅ TravelWorker: RUNNING (logs show "Starting worker (tick interval: 60000ms)")
- ✅ WebSocket server: RUNNING
- ✅ Health check endpoint: RESPONDING (status: healthy)

### 2. Code Implementation Verified

#### dmChatSecure.ts - Travel Action Handling:
- ✅ Line 249-251: Detects TRAVEL actions from chat
- ✅ Line 338-400: Creates travel_sessions with:
  - Calculated distance in miles
  - Destination coordinates
  - Travel mode (normal)
  - Status: 'active'
  - Starting tile discovery (5-tile radius)

#### travelWorker.ts - Travel Processing:
- ✅ Line 28-50: Constants configured:
  - TICK_INTERVAL_MS = 60000 (60 real-time seconds)
  - GAME_MINUTES_PER_TICK = 10 (1 real-time minute = 10 in-game minutes)
  - MILES_PER_TICK: { cautious: 0.333, normal: 0.5, hasty: 0.667 }

- ✅ Line 62-202: processTravelSessionTick():
  - Calculates intermediate position along path
  - Updates character position incrementally
  - Increments game_time_minutes by 10 each tick
  - Discovers tiles at new position every tick (5-tile radius)
  - Emits TRAVEL_PROGRESS via WebSocket
  - Rolls for encounters

- ✅ Line 207-306: rollForEncounter():
  - Checks for existing unresolved events
  - Rolls against ENCOUNTER_CHANCE
  - Generates events via travelService
  - Inserts to travel_events table
  - Broadcasts event via WebSocket if requires_response

- ✅ Line 311-338: tick():
  - Fetches all active travel_sessions
  - Processes each session
  - Runs every 60 real-time seconds

---

## Calendar System (Celestine Concordance)

**Days per week:** 8 days
- Dawnwatch, Suncrest, Firesday, Stormcall, Moondim, Starweave, Earthbind, Shadowfall

**Months per year:** 10 months
- Embersong, Frostveil, Galespire, Verdantide, Sunstill, Duskmantle, Nightglow, Tidebound, Stoneknot, Aurorayne

**Days per month:** 40 days

**Total days per year:** 400 days

**Calculation from game_time_minutes:**
```javascript
const totalMinutes = character.game_time_minutes;
const totalHours = totalMinutes / 60;
const totalDays = totalHours / 24;  // Assuming 24-hour days (configurable)

// Calculate calendar position
world_date_day = (totalDays % 40) + 1;  // 1-40
world_date_month = ((totalDays / 40) % 10) + 1;  // 1-10
world_date_year = Math.floor(totalDays / 400);
```

## Expected Behavior When Testing

### When Player Types: "I travel north 50 miles"

1. **Chat System (dmChatSecure.ts)**
   - Detects TRAVEL action
   - Creates travel_session with:
     - distance: 50 miles
     - destination: calculated from narrative
     - status: 'active'
   - Discovers starting tiles

2. **First TravelWorker Tick (60 real-time seconds)**
   - Moves character 0.5 miles along path
   - Updates game_time_minutes: 0 → 10
   - Discovers tiles at new position
   - Broadcasts TRAVEL_PROGRESS event
   - Rolls for encounter

3. **Subsequent Ticks (Every 60 real-time seconds)**
   - Repeats movement: +0.5 miles
   - Repeats time: +10 minutes
   - Repeats tile discovery
   - Continues until miles_traveled >= miles_total
   - On completion: marks session 'completed', character arrives

4. **Total Time for 50 Miles**
   - At 3 mph (normal mode): 50 ÷ 3 = 16.67 hours
   - Game-time needed: 16.67 × 60 = 1000 minutes
   - Real-time needed: 1000 ÷ 10 = 100 ticks
   - Real time: 100 × 60 seconds = 6000 seconds ≈ **100 real-time minutes**

## Files Created/Modified

### New Migrations:
1. `/srv/project-chimera/supabase/migrations/008_add_game_time_and_calendar.sql` - Game-time and calendar fields
2. `/srv/project-chimera/supabase/migrations/009_create_travel_sessions_table.sql` - Travel sessions table
3. `/srv/project-chimera/supabase/migrations/010_create_travel_events_table.sql` - Travel events table

### Already Modified (Previous Work):
1. `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/routes/dmChatSecure.ts` - Travel session creation
2. `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/workers/travelWorker.ts` - Travel progression with game-time

### Test File Created:
1. `/srv/project-chimera/test_travel_system.ts` - Integration test (needs auth setup to run)

---

## How to Run the Actual Test (Part A: Manual Testing)

Since automated testing requires Supabase auth setup, here's the manual test procedure:

### Step 1: Open Web Frontend
```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Step 2: Create Character
- Select race, class, abilities
- Note starting position (should be around 0,0)
- Note initial game_time_minutes (should be 0)

### Step 3: Chat with DM
Send message: **"I want to travel north to explore. Tell me about a journey of about 50 miles."**

Expected response: Narrative about starting travel, mentioning distance

### Step 4: Monitor Backend Logs
```bash
podman compose logs -f backend | grep -i "travel\|game time"
```

Expected output (every 60 seconds):
```
[TravelWorker] Processing 1 active travel session(s)
[TravelWorker] Session xxx: 1% complete (0.50/50.00 miles)
[TravelWorker] Moved character to (X, Y) - Game time: 0h 10m
[TravelWorker] Revealed tiles around character position
```

### Step 5: Check Position Updates
- Refresh map in frontend
- Position should gradually move north
- Map area should expand as tiles are discovered

### Step 6: Verify After 2 Real Minutes
- Check character sheet
- position_x/position_y should be ~1 mile from start
- game_time_minutes should be ~20 (2 minutes × 10)
- Map should show expanded explored area

### Step 7: Wait for Journey to Complete
- For 50-mile journey at 3 mph: ~100 real-time minutes
- Character will arrive automatically
- Travel session status will be 'completed'

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Post-Testing):
1. Integrate Gemini to generate calendar flavor text
2. Add calendar display to character sheet showing current date
3. Enhance travel events with Gemini-generated descriptions
4. Add per-character calendar tracking (store world_date fields)
5. Create migration to populate calendar fields from game_time_minutes

### Medium Term (Future Features):
1. Add rest mechanic (advance time without moving)
2. Add weather system tied to calendar
3. Add seasonal events (monsters appear in certain seasons)
4. Create faction mission calendar
5. Add quest deadlines based on calendar date
