# ✅ BUG FIXED - Map System Complete!

## GPT-5 Pro Found and Fixed the Bug!

### The Root Cause
**Destroyed MapScene instances were still receiving `zone/load` events!**

**The Problem:**
1. MapScene subscribed to bridge events in `create()`
2. Only unsubscribed in `handleShutdown()`
3. Phaser can fire `DESTROY` without `SHUTDOWN`
4. Destroyed scene kept listeners active
5. Delayed `zone/load` event → destroyed scene tries to load
6. LoaderPlugin already destroyed (cache = null)
7. **CRASH:** "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'iterate')"

**Why Dashboard Failed:**
- Delayed zone loading (fetches character data first)
- React StrictMode + wrapper components
- Triggers DESTROY path without SHUTDOWN
- Destroyed scene receives zone/load event
- Null loader.cache

**Why MapPreview Worked:**
- Loads zone immediately
- Finishes before any teardown
- No race condition

## The Fix (Applied)

### 1. MapScene.handleDestroy() - Cleanup listeners
```typescript
private handleDestroy() {
  // CRITICAL FIX: Prevent destroyed scene from receiving events
  this.scale.off(Phaser.Scale.Events.RESIZE, this.handleScaleResize, this);
  this.unsubscribers.forEach((unsub) => unsub());
  this.unsubscribers = [];

  // Rest of cleanup...
}
```

### 2. ZoomableGameCanvas - Guard scene access
```typescript
if (scene && scene.cameras && scene.sys && scene.sys.isActive()) {
  scene.cameras.main.setZoom(zoom);
}
```
