# Today's Work Summary - Mapping System Complete

## What We Built

### 1. Complete Phaser 3 Mapping System
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (with known texture loading issue to resolve)

**Components Created:**
- Phaser 3 + React integration (hooks, providers, canvas)
- Procedural generation (dungeons, biomes, hybrid worlds)
- Map persistence backend (API + database)
- Zoom and fullscreen controls
- Chat-centered UI layout

**Files:** 20+ new files (~3000 lines of code)

### 2. Personalized Onboarding System
**Status:** ✅ CODE GENERATED (ready to apply)

**What It Does:**
- Gemini Pro generates unique opening scene for each character
- Uses background (Soldier, Acolyte, etc.)
- References backstory (ideal, bond, flaw)
- Creates initial personalized quest
- Stores in dm_conversations + quests + journal

**File:** `backend/src/services/onboardingService.ts` (456 lines)

---

## Current Status

### Working:
- ✅ Backend map persistence API
- ✅ Procedural world generation
  - Dungeons (rot.js Digger)
  - Biomes (cellular automata)
  - Hybrid worlds (village + wilderness + POIs)
- ✅ Chat-centered dashboard layout
- ✅ Zoom controls and fullscreen
- ✅ Chat backend fixed (empty actions error)
- ✅ Onboarding service generated

### Needs Fix:
- ⚠️ Phaser texture loading (renderer null error)
  - Works on /map-preview page
  - Fails on dashboard
  - Timing/initialization issue

---

## The Texture Loading Issue

**Error:** `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'renderer')`
**Location:** MapScene.ts when loading data URI tilesets
**Impact:** Map doesn't render in dashboard

**Why it happens:**
- Phaser's renderer isn't ready when zone loads
- Data URI textures trigger createCanvas()
- Renderer is null at that moment

**Possible Solutions:**
1. Wait for renderer ready event before loading zones
2. Use Phaser's preload() phase
3. Switch to external tileset images (not data URIs)
4. Delay zone loading until game.isBooted

**Recommendation:** Use external tileset PNGs instead of data URIs (simpler, more reliable)

## What Character Onboarding Will Do

### Example: Aria (Acolyte, Neutral Good)
**Backstory:** Seeking lost mentor, trusts too easily

**Generated Opening:**
```
The road to Wayward Hamlet has been long. As Sister Aria
crests the hill, the village appears - weathered buildings
against encroaching forest. Your mentor's final letter
mentioned this place, though the paper is worn from
constant reading.

The villagers eye you warily. Few clerics come this far
from civilization. The innkeeper nods toward an empty table.

Your hand touches the pendant at your throat - your mentor's
final gift before they vanished into these woods three
months ago. Faith has brought you this far.
```

**Initial Quest:** "Whispers in the Temple Ruins"
The innkeeper mentions old ruins to the north - once a temple,
now avoided. Perhaps your mentor sought answers there...

## Next Steps

### Option A: Fix Map First
1. Switch to external PNG tilesets (remove data URIs)
2. Use Kenney assets we downloaded
3. Map will render reliably

### Option B: Implement Onboarding First
1. Apply generated onboarding code
2. Add endpoint to characters route
3. Wire frontend to call on first login
4. Characters get personalized openings

### Option C: Both in Parallel
Use multiple agents to fix map and implement onboarding simultaneously

---

## Recommendation

**Fix the map first (Option A)** - it's close to working and blocking UX.
Then implement onboarding (quick win after map works).

**Or:** I can investigate the Phaser issue more deeply with GPT-5's debug agent.
