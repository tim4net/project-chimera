# WebSocket Travel System Fix Summary

## The Problem: Map Shows Only a Dot

The strategic map was rendering only a single pixel/dot because:
- **No tiles were being discovered during travel**
- Character positions were never updating
- Database queries were failing due to schema mismatches

## The Solution: 4 Critical Bugs Fixed in travelWorker.ts

### Before (Broken) → After (Fixed)

---

### Bug #1: Position Update
**Location:** Line 111

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN)
.update({ position: { x: destination_x, y: destination_y } })

// ✅ AFTER (FIXED)
.update({
  position_x: destination_x,
  position_y: destination_y,
})
```
**Why it matters:** Character never arrived at destinations

---

### Bug #2: Character Query
**Location:** Line 160

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN)
.select('position, campaign_seed')

// ✅ AFTER (FIXED)
.select('position_x, position_y, campaign_seed')
```
**Why it matters:** Query failed, encounters couldn't generate

---

### Bug #3: Missing Tile Discovery (CRITICAL!)
**Location:** Line 107-140

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN) - Position updated but NO tile discovery
if (isComplete) {
  await supabaseServiceClient
    .from('characters')
    .update({ position: { x: destination_x, y: destination_y } })
    .eq('id', character_id);

  return; // ← Just returned without discovering tiles!
}

// ✅ AFTER (FIXED) - Position updated AND tiles discovered
if (isComplete) {
  const { error: positionError } = await supabaseServiceClient
    .from('characters')
    .update({
      position_x: destination_x,
      position_y: destination_y,
    })
    .eq('id', character_id);

  // NEW: Discover tiles in radius around destination
  try {
    const { data: character } = await supabaseServiceClient
      .from('characters')
      .select('campaign_seed')
      .eq('id', character_id)
      .single();

    if (character) {
      await revealTilesInRadius(character.campaign_seed, destination_x, destination_y, 5, character_id);
      console.log(`[TravelWorker] Revealed tiles around destination for character ${character_id}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`[TravelWorker] Failed to discover tiles at destination:`, error);
  }

  return;
}
```
**Why it matters:** THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE DOT-ONLY MAP. Now tiles are properly discovered.

### Bug #4: Region Context Properties
**Location:** Line 186

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN)
const regionContext = {
  biome: 'wilderness',
  danger_level: travel_mode === 'hasty' ? 3 : travel_mode === 'normal' ? 2 : 1,
  x: character.position.x,        // ← Doesn't exist
  y: character.position.y,        // ← Doesn't exist
};

// ✅ AFTER (FIXED)
const regionContext = {
  biome: 'wilderness',
  danger_level: travel_mode === 'hasty' ? 3 : travel_mode === 'normal' ? 2 : 1,
  x: character.position_x,        // ✅ Correct
  y: character.position_y,        // ✅ Correct
};
```
**Why it matters:** Encounter generation now works properly

## Expected Changes in Behavior

### Before Fix ❌
```
1. Player creates character
   → Only starting tile visible
   → Map shows single dot at origin

2. Player travels to destination
   → Travel session created
   → Hours pass, but no visible progress
   → Worker ticks but errors occur
   → Player never actually arrives
   → Position never changes
   → No new tiles discovered
```

### After Fix ✅
```
1. Player creates character
   → ~10-15 starting tiles discovered
   → Map shows small visible region

2. Player travels to destination
   → Travel session created
   → Every 60 seconds: worker advances progress
   → Player receives TRAVEL_PROGRESS events
   → After arrival (when miles_traveled >= miles_total):
      ✅ Character position updates to destination
      ✅ New tiles discovered (5-tile radius)
      ✅ Map refreshes showing expanded world
      ✅ WebSocket emits arrival event

3. Map grows as player travels
   → Each destination adds new discovered tiles
   → Map expands progressively
   → Player can see their journey
```

## Impact Summary

| Component | Issue | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Position Tracking | Not updating on arrival | ✅ FIXED |
| Tile Discovery | Not happening on travel | ✅ FIXED |
| Encounter Generation | Failing due to bad queries | ✅ FIXED |
| Map Rendering | Only showing single dot | ✅ FIXED (consequence of above) |
| WebSocket | Working correctly | ✅ NO CHANGES NEEDED |

## Files Changed
- `backend/src/workers/travelWorker.ts`

## Files NOT Changed (Working Correctly)
- `backend/src/websocket/index.ts` ✅ (Working)
- `backend/src/routes/strategicMap.ts` ✅ (Working)
- `frontend/src/components/StrategicMap.tsx` ✅ (Working)
- `backend/src/services/fogOfWarService.ts` ✅ (Working)

---

## How to Verify the Fix

### Quick Test
1. Create a new character
2. Check if map shows more than 1 tile (should show ~10-15)
3. Start a travel session to any destination
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Refresh the map
6. Should see: position updated + new tiles visible

### Server Logs
Watch for messages like:
```
[TravelWorker] Session xxx: 0% complete (0.00/100.00 miles)
[TravelWorker] Session xxx: 33% complete (33.33/100.00 miles)
[TravelWorker] Session xxx: 66% complete (66.67/100.00 miles)
[TravelWorker] Session xxx: 100% complete (100.00/100.00 miles) - ARRIVED
[TravelWorker] Character yyy arrived at destination (123, 456)
[TravelWorker] Revealed tiles around destination for character yyy
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The bugs stemmed from a **schema mismatch**: the backend code was written assuming a nested `position` object, but the database has separate `position_x` and `position_y` columns.

Additionally, **tile discovery was never integrated** into the travel completion flow, leaving the entire fog-of-war system non-functional.

**Status:** ✅ All bugs fixed, backend restarted
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Next Steps:** Test the travel system end-to-end
