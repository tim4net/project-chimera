# D&D 5e Subclass System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Successfully integrated the complete D&D 5e subclass system into Nuaibria, enabling players to select subclasses at appropriate levels and automatically receive subclass features as they level up.

---

## What Was Implemented

### Database Layer
- Added `subclass` column (TEXT, nullable)
- Added `subclass_features` column (JSONB array)
- Created index for performance
- Migration applied successfully via Supabase

### Backend Services
- **SubclassService**: Core business logic (210 lines)
- **Subclass Routes**: RESTful API endpoints (155 lines)
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces
- **Integration**: Character creation and leveling system

### Frontend Components
- **SubclassSelectionModal**: Selection UI (279 lines)
- **Character Creation**: Integrated subclass selection
- **Level-Up Modal**: Subclass selection at level-ups
- **Character Display**: Shows subclass in character sheet

### Flow 2: Create Bard (L3 Subclass)

1. Player selects Bard class during character creation
2. Character created at **Level 0** with `tutorial_state: 'needs_cantrips'`

4. Character reaches Level 1, plays normally
5. **Level 3:** Level-up modal shows subclass selection required
6. SubclassSelectionModal appears

## API Documentation

### GET /api/subclass/:id/available-subclasses

**Description:** Get available subclasses for a character's class

**Response:**
```json
{
  "subclasses": [
    {
      "name": "College of Lore",
      "class": "Bard",
      "subclassFlavor": "Bard College",
      "description": "Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things...",
      "features": [...]
    }
  ],
  "needsSelection": true,
  "currentSubclass": null
}
```

### POST /api/subclass/:id/subclass

**Description:** Assign a subclass to a character

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "subclassName": "College of Lore"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "character": { ... },
  "message": "Successfully selected College of Lore subclass"
}
```

**Validation:**
- Subclass must be valid for character's class
- Character must be at appropriate level
- Character must not already have a subclass

---

## Database Schema

### characters Table (New Columns)

```sql
subclass TEXT DEFAULT NULL
  -- Stores subclass name (e.g., "College of Lore")
  -- Nullable for backwards compatibility

subclass_features JSONB DEFAULT '[]'
  -- Array of SubclassFeatureGrant objects
  -- Example: [
  --   {
  --     "name": "Cutting Words",
  --     "level": 3,
  --     "description": "...",
  --     "grantedAt": "2025-10-20T12:34:56.789Z"
  --   }
  -- ]
```

---

## Technical Details

### Subclass Feature Granting

**When features are granted:**
1. **Initial Assignment**: When subclass is first selected, grants ALL features up to current level
2. **Level-Up**: Grants new features for the new level reached
3. **Retroactive**: If character somehow missed selection, grants all features when finally assigned

**Example (Bard selecting College of Lore at Level 3):**
```javascript
// Immediately grants:
- Bonus Proficiencies (Level 3)
- Cutting Words (Level 3)

// Later, at Level 6:
- Additional Magical Secrets (Level 6)

// Later, at Level 14:
- Peerless Skill (Level 14)
```

### Feature Storage Format

```typescript
{
  name: "Cutting Words",
  level: 3,
  description: "You learn how to use your wit to distract...",
  grantedAt: "2025-10-20T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

Stored in `characters.subclass_features` as JSONB array.

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Cleric Character Creation (L1 Subclass)

```bash
# Create new Cleric
# Expected: SubclassSelectionModal appears
# Options: Life Domain
# After selection: Character has subclass, starts at Level 1
```

**Verification:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/characters/{id} | jq '.subclass'
# Expected: "Life Domain"

curl http://localhost:3001/api/characters/{id} | jq '.subclass_features'
# Expected: Array with "Bonus Proficiency" and "Disciple of Life"
```

### Test 2: Bard Level-Up (L3 Subclass)

```bash
# Create Bard (no subclass yet)
# Level to 3
# Expected: Subclass selection modal appears
# Select "College of Lore"
```

**Verification:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/characters/{id} | jq '.subclass'
# Expected: "College of Lore"

curl http://localhost:3001/api/characters/{id} | jq '.level'
# Expected: 3
```

### Test 3: Backend API Endpoints

```bash
# Get available subclasses for a character
curl http://localhost:3001/api/subclass/{characterId}/available-subclasses

# Assign a subclass
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/subclass/{characterId}/subclass \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"subclassName": "Champion"}'
```

## Known Issues & Future Work

### Known Issues

1. **Frontend TypeScript Warnings**: Pre-existing unused variables in App.tsx and DashboardPage (not related to subclass system)
2. **Auth Token**: SubclassSelectionModal uses localStorage instead of auth context
3. **No Domain Spells**: Cleric domain spells not automatically added yet (requires spell system integration)

### Future Enhancements

**Phase 2 Features:**
1. Domain spell granting for Clerics
2. Warlock invocation selection (separate from subclass)
3. Subclass-specific spell lists
4. Feature tooltips with full descriptions
5. Subclass change/respec (with appropriate restrictions)

**UI Improvements:**
1. Subclass icons/badges
2. Visual themes per subclass
3. Feature comparison view before selection
4. Subclass lore integration

**Analytics:**
1. Track most popular subclass choices
2. Feature usage statistics
3. Level distribution by subclass

---

## Success Metrics

### Implementation Goals

✅ **Database Schema**: Subclass columns added successfully
✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript types with no compile errors
✅ **Backend Services**: Complete subclass service with 6 core functions
✅ **API Endpoints**: 2 RESTful endpoints for subclass management
✅ **Character Creation**: L1 subclass selection integrated
✅ **Leveling System**: Automatic feature granting on level-up
✅ **Frontend UI**: Selection modal and display components
✅ **File Size Compliance**: All files under 300 lines
✅ **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing characters unaffected

### D&D 5e Compliance

✅ **Correct Selection Levels**: L1 (Cleric/Warlock), L2 (Druid/Wizard), L3 (others)
✅ **SRD Subclasses**: All 12 core subclasses available
✅ **Feature Progression**: Features granted at correct levels (3, 6, 10, 14, etc.)
✅ **One Subclass Rule**: Characters can only have one subclass
✅ **No Multiclass Subclass**: Subclass tied to primary class only

## Deployment Status

**Backend:**
- ✅ Built and deployed
- ✅ Server running on port 3001
- ✅ All routes registered
- ✅ Migration applied to production database

**Frontend:**
- ✅ Components created
- ⚠️ Not yet deployed (build has pre-existing TypeScript warnings)
- ⚠️ Frontend build needed

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Frontend TypeScript Warnings** (pre-existing, not from subclass system)
   - Remove unused imports in App.tsx and DashboardPage.tsx
   - Clean up unused variables

2. **Build and Deploy Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   podman compose restart frontend
   ```

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Create Cleric, verify subclass selection
   - Create Bard, level to 3, verify subclass selection
   - Verify existing characters still work

### Future Integration

1. **Domain Spells**: Integrate with spell system to auto-grant domain spells
2. **Warlock Invocations**: Separate from subclass but related feature
3. **Multiclassing**: Ensure subclass is tied to original class only
4. **Subclass in Portraits**: Include subclass context in character portrait generation

---

## Code Compliance

All implemented code follows project standards:
- ✅ TypeScript-only (no .js files)
- ✅ Files under 300 lines (Service: 210, Routes: 155, Modal: 279)
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Uses existing patterns (Supabase client, requireAuth, etc.)
- ✅ Secure (auth required, validation, no SQL injection)

---

## Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Backend + Frontend Code Ready)
**Deployment:** Backend deployed, Frontend needs build
**Testing:** Ready for end-to-end testing
**Documentation:** Complete
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Implementers:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (Planning), Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Coordination), Multiple AI Agents (Implementation)
