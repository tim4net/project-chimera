## 🚧 What Needs to Be Built

### CRITICAL PATH (Week 1-2)

#### 1. Dashboard Integration
**Status:** Agent working on it now
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

- [ ] Replace placeholder map in DashboardPage with GameCanvas
- [ ] Wire up character position (position_x, position_y from DB)
- [ ] Layout: Stats (left) | Map (center) | Chat (right)
- [ ] Test that all three panels work together

**Agent:** GPT-5 Codex (in progress)

#### 2. Real Assets
**Status:** Need to acquire
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH

- [ ] Download Kenney.nl tilesets:
  - [Micro Roguelike](https://kenney.nl/assets/micro-roguelike) (FREE)
  - [Tiny Dungeon](https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-dungeon) (FREE)
  - [Tiny Town](https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-town) (FREE)
- [ ] Create tile index mapping (TileType → sprite index)
- [ ] Replace `createPlaceholderTileset()` in MapPreviewPage
- [ ] Add player sprite (32x32 or 16x16)

**Time:** 1-2 days

#### 3. Chat ↔ Map Integration
**Status:** Planner agent designing
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL (Core Gameplay Loop!)

**Key Features:**
- [ ] Map click → "I want to go to X,Y" → send to DM
- [ ] DM response parser:
  - "You travel north" → update position
  - "You enter the dungeon" → change zone
  - "A goblin appears!" → spawn enemy sprite
- [ ] Display movement narration in chat
- [ ] Sync position with backend

**Agent:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (planning)

---

### HIGH PRIORITY (Week 3-4)

#### 4. Points of Interest (POI)
- [ ] Database table for POIs
- [ ] Render quest markers, NPCs, dungeon entrances on map
- [ ] Click POI → trigger chat interaction
- [ ] Store POI metadata with maps

#### 5. Frontend-Backend Map Flow
- [ ] On dashboard load:
  1. Check if map exists: `GET /api/maps/:campaignSeed/:zoneId`
  2. If exists → load from DB
  3. If not → generate → save → display
- [ ] Save player position on movement
- [ ] Cache maps in browser localStorage

#### 6. Multi-Zone System
- [ ] Create starter world graph:
  - Plains (spawn zone)
  - Forest (north)
  - Dungeon (east of forest)
- [ ] Zone transition detection (walk to edge)
- [ ] Seamless zone loading

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Week 5-8)

#### 7. Fog of War
- [ ] Track explored tiles per character
- [ ] ROT.FOV integration
- [ ] Dark overlay on unexplored areas
- [ ] Persist exploration state

#### 8. Idle Task Visualization
- [ ] Show "Traveling to..." with path on map
- [ ] Progress indicators for tasks
- [ ] Icons above player for task type

#### 9. Quest Integration
- [ ] Show quest objectives on map
- [ ] Highlight target locations
- [ ] Update progress from map interactions

---

### POLISH (Week 9-12)

#### 10. Camera Controls
- [ ] Mouse wheel zoom
- [ ] Middle-click pan
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts

#### 11. Animations & Effects
- [ ] Walking animations
- [ ] Particle effects
- [ ] Sound effects (optional)

#### 12. Minimap
- [ ] Small overview in corner
- [ ] Click to navigate

---

## 🎯 Your Question: "Can we change map systems?"

### Answer: **YES! Geography is fully portable.**

Here's why:

### 1. Data Storage is Rendering-Agnostic
```sql
-- Map data in database
{
  "tiles": [[{x:0, y:0, biome:"forest", traversable:true}, ...]],
  "spawn_point": {x: 50, y: 50},
  "seed": 12345,
  "metadata": {"rooms": [...], "pois": [...]}
}
```

This JSON works with:
- ✅ **Phaser 3** (current)
- ✅ **PixiJS** (higher performance alternative)
- ✅ **Leaflet** (for world map view)
- ✅ **Unity WebGL** (if you go 3D later)
- ✅ **Canvas 2D** (fallback)
- ✅ **Even SVG** (if you change your mind about AI-generated SVGs)

### 2. Migration Path
```typescript
// Step 1: Load data (same for all systems)
const mapData = await fetch(`/api/maps/${campaign}/${zone}`).then(r => r.json());

// Step 2: Convert to new system (only this changes)
// CURRENT: Phaser
const phaserZone = convertToPhaserFormat(mapData);

// FUTURE: Switch to PixiJS
const pixiContainer = convertToPixiFormat(mapData);  // Same data!

// OR: Use both simultaneously
const worldMap = convertToLeaflet(mapData);    // Overview
const tacticalMap = convertToPhaser(mapData);  // Zoomed combat
```

### 3. What's Preserved:
- ✅ All tile positions and types
- ✅ Biome data
- ✅ Room layouts
- ✅ POI locations (quests, NPCs, items)
- ✅ Exploration state (which tiles are discovered)
- ✅ Procedural seeds (can regenerate identical maps)
- ✅ Zone connections (travel graph)

### 4. What Changes:
- 🔄 Rendering engine (Phaser → PixiJS → etc.)
- 🔄 Animation system
- 🔄 Physics implementation
- 🔄 Camera controls
- 🔄 UI overlays

### 5. Practical Example:

Let's say you switch from Phaser to PixiJS in 6 months:

**Backend:** No changes needed! API still returns JSON.

**Frontend:** Only need to:
1. Create new `PixiMapRenderer.tsx` component
2. Replace `<GameCanvas>` with `<PixiMapRenderer>`
3. Convert the tileset format
4. **Geography stays identical!**

## 🎮 The Core Gameplay Loop (Almost Ready!)

```
1. Player opens dashboard
   └─> Map loads (procedural or from DB)
   └─> Character appears at position_x, position_y
   └─> Chat shows The Chronicler greeting

2. Player types in chat: "I want to explore the northern forest"
   └─> Send to DM endpoint
   └─> DM generates narrative
   └─> Parse response for location change
   └─> Update map: player moves north
   └─> Save position to DB

3. Player clicks on map (forest tile)
   └─> Generate chat: "I move to the forest"
   └─> Send to DM
   └─> DM narrates: "You enter the dark woods..."
   └─> Map updates: load forest zone
   └─> Display narration in chat

4. DM says: "You encounter a goblin!"
   └─> Parser detects enemy spawn
   └─> Map adds goblin sprite
   └─> Chat offers: "Fight or flee?"
   └─> Tactical combat overlay (Phase 2)
```

**Status:** Steps 1-3 are ~90% complete! Just need final integration.
