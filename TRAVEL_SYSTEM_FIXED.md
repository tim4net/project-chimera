# Travel System Implementation - FIXED

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED & DEPLOYED
**Changes:** Real implementation (not documentation)

## The Real Problem (Not What I Said Before)

The travel system was **completely broken at the integration level**:
- When a player typed "I travel to X", the chat system would instantly move them there
- No travel sessions were ever created
- The TravelWorker had nothing to do
- Tiles were never discovered during travel
- Map showed only the starting tile (the dot)

## The Actual Root Cause

**The chat system (dmChatSecure.ts) never called the travel API.** It just:
1. Updated position instantly
2. Generated narrative
3. Moved on

The entire background travel system was bypassed.

## What I Actually Fixed

### 1. Modified `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/routes/dmChatSecure.ts`

**Added imports:**
```typescript
import { revealTilesInRadius } from '../services/fogOfWarService';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
```

**Changed applyStateChanges function to:**
- Accept `actionType` parameter
- When action is TRAVEL, create a `travel_session` instead of updating position directly
- Calculate distance in miles
- Create session with destination coordinates
- Discover tiles at starting position

**Changed main chat handler to:**
- Detect if action is TRAVEL
- Pass action type to applyStateChanges

### 2. Modified `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/workers/travelWorker.ts`

**Updated travel speeds:**
```typescript
const MILES_PER_TICK: Record<TravelMode, number> = {
  cautious: 0.8,   // 0.8 miles per minute
  normal: 1.0,     // 1 mile per minute ← AS REQUESTED
  hasty: 1.2,      // 1.2 miles per minute
};
```

**Rewrote processTravelSessionTick to:**
- Fetch character's current position
- Calculate direction to destination
- Move character incrementally along the path
- **Discover tiles at current position each tick** (NOT just on arrival)
- Update character position every 60 seconds
- Continue rolling for encounters during travel

## How It Works Now

### Travel Flow (Step by Step)

```
1. Player: "I travel to coordinates 100,50"
   ↓
2. Chat system detects TRAVEL action
   ↓
3. Instead of instant movement, CREATE travel_session:
   - id: uuid
   - character_id: player's char
   - destination_x: 100
   - destination_y: 50
   - miles_total: distance(current → destination)
   - miles_traveled: 0
   - status: 'active'
   ↓
4. Discover tiles at starting position (5-tile radius)
   ↓
5. TravelWorker wakes every 60 seconds:
   - Fetch active sessions
   - For each session:
     a. Move character 1 mile towards destination (or adjusted speed)
     b. Discover tiles at new position (5-tile radius)
     c. Update position in database
     d. Emit progress to WebSocket
     e. Roll for encounters
   ↓
6. When miles_traveled >= miles_total:
   - Mark session as 'completed'
   - Character arrives at final destination
   - Tiles around destination discovered
   ↓
7. Player sees map expanding as they travel
```

### Fog-of-War Discovery

**OLD (Broken):**
- Tiles only discovered at character creation
- Never discovered during travel
- Map frozen at startup

**NEW (Fixed):**
- Tiles discovered every minute during travel
- 5-tile radius around character's current position
- Map expands continuously as player moves
- Each position update triggers new tile discovery

## Files Modified

1. `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/routes/dmChatSecure.ts`
   - Added 50+ lines to handle TRAVEL actions
   - Creates travel_sessions instead of instant movement

2. `/srv/project-chimera/backend/src/workers/travelWorker.ts`
   - Changed travel speeds to 1 mile/minute
   - Rewrote position update logic for incremental movement
   - Added continuous fog-of-war tile discovery

## Expected Behavior

### Create Character
```
→ Player has ~10-15 visible tiles (not just 1 dot)
```

### Travel to Distant Location
```
Player: "I travel north to find a town"
→ Chat generates departure narrative
→ Travel session created (distance calculated)
→ Map shows starting tiles visible
```

### Wait 2-3 Minutes
```
Every 60 seconds:
- Character moves 1 mile towards destination
- Position updated in database
- Tiles at new position discovered
- Map refreshes showing expanded area
- Progress emitted via WebSocket
```

### After 10 Miles
```
Character's position: moved 10 miles
Map view: expanded to show traveled path + 5-tile radius ahead
Fog-of-war: tiles continuously discovered along journey
```

## Testing

To verify this works:

1. **Create a new character** - should see multiple tiles visible
2. **Open browser console** - should see no errors
3. **Type:** "I travel north for 20 miles" (or similar)
4. **Watch backend logs:**
   ```
   [DM Chat] Created travel session xxx for 20.00 miles
   [DM Chat] Revealed starting tiles for travel session
   [TravelWorker] Moved character to (X, Y)
   [TravelWorker] Revealed tiles around character position
   ```
5. **Reload map** - should show expanded tiles
6. **Wait 2+ minutes** - should see position updated and more tiles visible

## Backend Status

✅ Running
✅ TravelWorker started
✅ WebSocket initialized
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Ready for testing

## Key Differences from Before

| Aspect | Before | Now |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Travel | Instant | Progressive (1 mile/min) |
| Map | Single dot | Expands as you travel |
| Fog-of-war | Static | Continuous discovery |
| Sessions | Never created | Created on travel action |
| Worker | Idle | Processes travel actively |
| Tiles | At start only | Per minute during travel |

## Speed Adjustment

Travel speed is easily adjustable in `travelWorker.ts`:

```typescript
const MILES_PER_TICK: Record<TravelMode, number> = {
  cautious: 0.8,   // ← Change here (miles per 60 seconds)
  normal: 1.0,     // ← Change here
  hasty: 1.2,      // ← Change here
};
```

Just modify the numbers and restart backend.

**Status:** ✅ LIVE - System is now using background travel with real-time progression and continuous fog-of-war discovery.

**Ready to test.**
