                 a final shriek. Searching its corpse, you find 12 gold
                 and a serviceable short sword. A nearby farmer approaches:
                 'Thank you, brave warrior! I have another problem - wolves

     cave! Please, clear them out. I'll pay 50 gold!'
     [Quest accepted: Clear the Goblin Cave - Kill 5 goblins]"
  ↓
Player: "I attack the goblin"
  ↓
DM: "Your blade strikes true! Roll: 1d20+5 = 18 (hit!). Damage: 1d8+3 = 9.
     The goblin collapses! You find 8 gold and a rusty dagger on its corpse.
     [Quest progress: 1/5 goblins defeated]"
  ↓
Player: "I equip the dagger as my off-hand weapon"
  ↓
DM: "You sheath the dagger at your belt, ready for quick draws."
  ↓
[After defeating 5 goblins]

DM: "🎉 Quest Complete! Clear the Goblin Cave - Rewards: 200 XP, 50 gold!
     🎉 LEVEL UP! You've reached level 4! HP increased by 7 (30 → 37)!
