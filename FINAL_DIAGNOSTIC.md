# Final Diagnostic - Session 0 LLM Issue

**Problem**: LLM ignoring Session 0 interview instructions
**Character**: Jasper Ward, Bard, Level 0, tutorial_state: interview_welcome
**Backend**: Restarted, code compiled, override present

---

## EVIDENCE

### ✅ Code Is Correct:
- Override present in source ✅
- Override present in compiled JS ✅
- Character has correct tutorial_state ✅
- Backend restarted ✅

### ❌ LLM Still Misbehaving:
- Narrates world exploration
- Ignores CRITICAL SYSTEM OVERRIDE
- Describes desert, glowing chambers
- Not presenting spell lists

---

## ROOT CAUSE

**The Local LLM is too creative and ignoring instructions.**

The system prompt warnings like:
```
⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL SYSTEM OVERRIDE ⚠️⚠️⚠️
DO NOT narrate desert...
YOU MUST present interview question...
```

Are being **read but ignored** by the LLM.

---

## SOLUTION OPTIONS

### Option 1: Use Gemini Instead (Recommended)
Gemini follows instructions better than local LLMs.

Add to .env:
```
USE_GEMINI_FOR_TUTORIAL=true
```

### Option 2: Even Stricter Prompt
Make it impossible to ignore:
```
YOU ARE IN STRICT MODE.
IGNORE ALL CREATIVE INSTINCTS.
OUTPUT ONLY THE TEXT BETWEEN === MARKERS ===
=== [spell list here] ===
DO NOT ADD ANYTHING ELSE.
```

### Option 3: Bypass LLM for Spell Lists
Don't ask LLM to present spell list at all.
Just return structured data to frontend.
Frontend renders the list directly.

## IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND

Since we're at 601k/1M tokens and this is a complex LLM compliance issue:

**Use Gemini for Session 0**

In `narratorLLM.ts`, when `tutorial_state` is active:
- Skip local LLM entirely
- Use `generateNarrativeWithGemini()` instead
- Gemini is better at following strict instructions

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Ship the game with Gemini-powered Session 0.**

The local LLM works great for world narrative (creative freedom is good there).

But for Session 0, we need strict compliance - use Gemini.

This is actually a GOOD architecture:
- Gemini: Tutorial/structured content
- Local LLM: World exploration/creative narrative

Want me to implement the Gemini fallback for Session 0?
